Load Balancer:
	When we do horizontal scaling, then each machine have it's own IP address.
	The client browser doesn't know about this address and hence we need load balancer.
	It acts as a medium to direct the request to one of the available machines.

Layer 4 Load Balancer:
	It decides which machine to call based on the IP address of the machines.

Layer 7 Load Balancer:
	It uses the data associated with a request to call a particular machine.
	Ex: A machine which has video resources might get the video request.

Hardware LB:
	It is a physical load balancer.
	It has dedicated resources.
	They are need specific.
	They are secure and encrypted.
	They can handle high load.
	Expensive since personalized.
	Ex: AWS

Software LB:
	It is flexible and can be changed.
	The resources are shared. (Ex: Docker Image)
	The machines are cost effective.

Active & Passive:
	To avoid single point of failure we have two balancer active and passive.
	It is redundancy -> Having a duplicate system.

Algorithms Of Load Balancer:
	1. Round Robin:	
		We go round with the first then second, and after last we again go to the first.

	2. Least Connection:
		We count the number of request associated with a connection and then select the least one.

	3. Least Response Time:
		The machine with least response time is provided the request.
		Eventually, the machines latency increases and hence new machine is selected.

	4. Weighted Round Robin:
		The machine gets the requests according to their capacity.
		he 32GB machine might get 2 * x requests then the 16GB machine.

	5. Sticky Load Balancing:
		When we get request from a user, we shift it to the same machine again and again.
